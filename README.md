# Acronym extraction from .xml file ( Java Implementation )

We try to extract Acronym from .xml file ( acron_collection_UTF8.xml in the folder )

We use a xml parser which split every sentence of our collection considering the tokens and some patterns we create.

You can find the results in excel files ( inside the folder )
